#  Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast stock prices using historical data fetched from **Yahoo Finance**. The goal is to build and train a deep learning model that can learn from time series data and predict future stock movements.

---

##  Features

-  Downloads historical stock data using `yfinance`
-  Preprocessing including normalization and sequence generation
-  LSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
-  Visualization of training vs. validation loss
-  Forecasting and comparison against actual stock prices

---

##  Data Source

Stock data is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) using the `yfinance` Python library.

## ðŸ“¥ Validation Loss
